Image Processing Application (.mlapp)

This IPApp application provides various image processing functionalities to manipulate and enhance images. Below is the list of functions available in this application:

## Programs:
1. Load Image
Load an image from your computer into the application for processing.

2. Save Modified Image
Save the currently displayed modified image to your computer.

3. Undo
Undo the last modification applied to the image.

4. Reset All
Reset the image to its original state, removing all modifications.

5. Change Resolution
Adjust the resolution (width and height) of the image.

6. Flipping Image (Horizontal/Vertical)
Flip the image horizontally or vertically.

7. Convert Gray to RGB
Convert a grayscale image to RGB format.

8. Convert to Black & White or Indexed
Convert the image to black and white or indexed color.

9. Thresholding
Apply thresholding to the image to segment objects based on intensity.

10. Cropping
Crop a specific region of interest from the image.

11. Add Text to Image
Overlay text onto the image, allowing for annotations or captions.

12. Add Filter (Average, Gaussian, Median)
Apply various filters such as average, Gaussian, or median to smooth or enhance the image.

13. Edge Detection (Canny, Sobel, Prewitt, Laplacian of Gaussian)
Detect edges in the image using different edge detection algorithms.

14. Add Noise (Salt & Pepper, Poisson, Speckle, Local Variance)
Introduce different types of noise to the image for testing or simulation purposes.

15. Histogram of Colors
Generate histograms to visualize the distribution of colors in the image.

16. Histogram Equalization
Enhance the contrast of the image using histogram equalization techniques.

17. Color Segmentation
Segment the image into different color regions.

18. Brightness
Adjust the brightness of the image.

19. Contrast
Adjust the contrast of the image.

20. Color Bit Depth
Modify the color bit depth of the image.

21. Rotate
Rotate the image by a specified angle.

22. RGB Planes
Display individual RGB planes of the image.

23. Exit
Close the application.
